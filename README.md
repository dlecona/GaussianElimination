# GaussianElimination
A program that will compute a system of linear equations using Gaussian's naive solution or with scaled-partial pivoting.

How to use:
  Have a file with the following format
  1) the first line will contain the amount of variables in the system (n)
  2) for (n) lines, write the coefficients of each respective variable
  3) Lastly, on the final line, have the constants
  
  EXAMPLE SYSTEM
  
      1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 = 1
      4x1 + 5x2 + 5x3 = 1
      7x1 + 8x2 + 9x3 = 1
  File will look like this:
  
     3
     1 2 3
     4 5 6
     7 8 9
     1 1 1
